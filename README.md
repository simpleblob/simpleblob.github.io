# simpleblob.github.io
My personal website

## Redirects
- `simpleblob.com`
- `rarelyrandom.com`
- `simpleblob.github.io`

## setup
- all the posts are written in emac org file, inside `myblog/posts/`. This place is also where I take all the notes and do a brain-dump.
- originally, hakyll was used to convert these org files into a static site. now I am changing that to custom python script because of familiarity. not done yet.
