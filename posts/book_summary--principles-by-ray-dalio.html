<h2 id="his-beliefs-and-concepts">His Beliefs and Concepts</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Principles&quot; - existing law of nature or mechanism behind it. Align and prosper, go against and be ruined.</li>
<li>Evolution - one of the greatest force in the universe, a natural movement towards adaptation. It applies to many human stuff, including morality &quot;good vs bad&quot;.</li>
<li>Evolution as a goal - desire to evolve is humanity's most pervasive driving force. &quot;personal evolutionary process&quot;</li>
<li>Hyper-realism - Map vs Territory. We should strive for the truth, accept it, or do something. Don't &quot;hope&quot; for better reality. An accurate understanding of reality is the essential foundation of good outcomes. therefore &quot;Brutal honesty/.&quot;</li>
<li>Independent thinking - consensus is often wrong (really? wisdom of crowds?) and bad opinions can be costly. So think for yourself and stress-test your idea with people smarter than you.</li>
<li>Failure is a feedback loop for learning, and a guiding light to good outcomes. The faster you learn the faster you get to the goals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="his-model-for-decision-making">His Model for Decision Making</h2>
<p><img src="../assets/ray1.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong> - your goals</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong> - intended results</p>
<p><strong>Machine</strong> - the process of achieving your gals. Basically 2 big things</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong> - good system that iteratively get you closer to your goals. (gradient descent)</p>
<p><strong>People</strong> - human elements in your machine.</p>
<h2 id="two-you-system-i-and-ii">&quot;Two&quot; You (System I and II)</h2>
<ul>
<li>One is the master planner - monitor and tweak your machine. ideal rationalist. free of emotion.</li>
<li>Another is an executor - treat yourself other &quot;people&quot; in your machine, looking top-down.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-process-to-getting-what-you-want-out-of-life">5-Step Process to getting what you want out of life</h2>
<ol>
<li>Choose your goals - have clear goals</li>
<li>Design a plan</li>
<li>Encounter problems (by executing your plan)</li>
<li>Diagnose the problems</li>
<li>Redesign or tweak a plan that will get will get you around your problems</li>
</ol>
<p>You must approach this as distinct steps (not blur them together). Because else you will not allocate appropriate time/effort for each step. And the process is iterative so good to do them in order.</p>
