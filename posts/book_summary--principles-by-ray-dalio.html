<h2 id="core-beliefs-and-concepts">Core Beliefs and Concepts</h2>
<p><strong>Principles:</strong> Laws of nature and mechanisms that
govern reality. Align with them and prosper. Go against them and be
ruined.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution:</strong> One of the greatest forces in the
universe. A natural movement towards adaptation. This applies to human
systems, including morality.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution as a goal:</strong> The desire to evolve is
humanity’s most pervasive driving force. Focus on your personal
evolutionary process.</p>
<p><strong>Hyper-realism:</strong> Map versus territory. Strive for
truth, accept it, then act. Don’t hope for a better reality. Accurate
understanding of reality is the essential foundation for good outcomes.
This demands brutal honesty.</p>
<p><strong>Independent thinking:</strong> Consensus is often wrong. Bad
opinions can be costly. Think for yourself and stress-test your ideas
with people smarter than you.</p>
<p><strong>Failure as feedback:</strong> Failure is a feedback loop for
learning and a guiding light to good outcomes. The faster you learn, the
faster you reach your goals.</p>
<h2 id="his-model-for-decision-making">His Model for Decision
Making</h2>
<p><img src="../assets/ray1.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong> - your goals</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong> - intended results</p>
<p><strong>Machine</strong> - the process of achieving your gals.
Basically 2 big things</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong> - good system that iteratively get you closer
to your goals. (gradient descent)</p>
<p><strong>People</strong> - human elements in your machine.</p>
<h2 id="the-two-yous">The Two Yous</h2>
<p>Think of yourself as two people:</p>
<p><strong>The master planner:</strong> Monitors and tweaks your
machine. An ideal rationalist. Free of emotion.</p>
<p><strong>The executor:</strong> Treat yourself as another person in
your machine. Look at yourself from the top down.</p>
<h2 id="five-step-process-to-get-what-you-want">Five-Step Process to Get
What You Want</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Choose your goals</strong> - Have clear goals</li>
<li><strong>Design a plan</strong> - Create a system to reach those
goals</li>
<li><strong>Encounter problems</strong> - Execute your plan and hit
obstacles</li>
<li><strong>Diagnose the problems</strong> - Understand what went
wrong</li>
<li><strong>Redesign the plan</strong> - Tweak your approach to get
around the problems</li>
</ol>
<p>Treat these as distinct steps. Don’t blur them together. Each step
needs appropriate time and effort. The process is iterative, so follow
them in order.</p>
