<h2 id="part-i.-two-systems">Part I. Two systems</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort
and conscious control.</p>
<p>System 2 uses attention and demands effort. Slow and orderly.</p>
<p><strong>System 1 examples</strong> - Detect moving objects, complete
familiar phrases, Detect/recognize random sounds.</p>
<p><strong>System 2 examples</strong> - Mental 2+ digits multiplication,
focus on voice of one person in a crowded room.</p>
<p>Experts often have vast and varied experiences in specific domain
such that they have the right "intuition". Example - firefighter
avoiding death​traps or chess master’s "checkmate in 5 moves".</p>
<p>System 1&amp;2 are fictitious characters, handy mental Models. They
don’t actually exist as separate entities in the brain.</p>
<p>The best we can do with these 2 systems is a compromise: learn to
recognize situations in which biases/mistakes are likely. Then System 2
is engaged to avoid them.</p>
<h3 id="attention-and-effort">Attention and Effort</h3>
<p>Pupil dilation indicates mental effort and engagement. A window to
your soul.</p>
<p>As a person becomes skilled, the demand for effort diminishes. Fewer
brain regions are involved. This is chunking into habits.</p>
<p>Talent has similar effects. Highly intelligent individuals need less
effort to solve the same problems.</p>
<p><strong>What is effortful:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adopting and terminating new task sets (never seen or tried
before)</li>
<li>Switching from one task to another (both of these are mindful
tasks)</li>
<li>Constantly using working memory to the fullest</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-lazy-controller">The Lazy Controller</h3>
<p>Ego Depletion - brain is running on limited fuel called glucose.
Manage them carefully. System 1 uses a lot more energy, so the brain
will switch to System 2 (indulgence) when depleted.</p>
<h3 id="associative-machine">Associative Machine</h3>
<p>Priming - system 1 has associative memory which triggers continuously
and unconsciously. Everyone is susceptible.</p>
<p>Priming effect is small but robust. It has the most impact when you
are uncertain or not thinking much (due to habit or time-to-decisions).
The effect depends on recent events - time series of short term
memory.</p>
<p>This means that society, environment and social group can affect your
mood and thoughts, beware!</p>
<p>Ideomotor effect = previous actions (like walking slowing) prime your
thoughts unconsciously (old age)</p>
<h3 id="cognitive-ease">Cognitive Ease</h3>
<p>Familiarity and ease engage System 1, making you more accepting and
gullible.</p>
<p>Unfamiliarity engages System 2, making you doubtful and critical.</p>
<p><strong>Mere exposure effect:</strong> Repetition induces cognitive
ease and familiarity. This works at the subconscious level because it
impacts System 1 directly.</p>
<h3 id="communicating-persuasively">Communicating Persuasively</h3>
<p>Reduce cognitive strain and put System 1 at ease:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use clear, legible font. Colors: black, red, blue.</li>
<li>Use simple, concise words. Put the work on the encoder, not the
decoder.</li>
<li>Make it memorable. Put it in verses if you can.</li>
<li>If you quote a source, choose easy-to-pronounce names.</li>
</ul>
<p>System 1 is doing greedy search, therefore good at positive and
one-sided affirmation. something like an excuse machine too. if we ask
it "why?", it will come up with a reason.</p>
<p>System 1 is gullible and biased to believe,</p>
<p>System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving.</p>
<p>Halo effect - 1st impression biases your view of the whole thing.
Order of information consumed matter! For example: Susan is friendly. 
Is she charitable? (System 1: probably yes!)</p>
<p>One - sided effect - System 1 always weave a story and jump to
conclusion with available data, no matter the quality and quantity. Be
especially CAREFUL when being presented with one sided information.</p>
<p>System 2 directs attention and searches memory to find answers.
System 2 does basic assessments computation continuously. Here’s some
examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>safety &amp; familiarity - good mood and cognitive ease when meeting
friends instead of strangers on the street. Under 1 sec
recognition.</li>
<li>Dominance &amp; competency - square jaw and confident smile. Best
Politician = strong chin + slight confident smile.</li>
<li>Sets &amp; prototypes - system 1 do well on estimating averages but
badly on sums. 100 vs 10k People died  = same effect.</li>
<li>Value intensity across dimensions - "how tall is a man who is as
tall as Julie was intelligent? "</li>
</ul>
