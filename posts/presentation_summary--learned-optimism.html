<p>Presentation is <a href="https://github.com/raganwald/presentations/blob/master/optimism.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>Optimism is the way we explain things that happened to us. There is no one &quot;correct&quot; way, since they are just different interpretations from the same information/situation.</p>
<p>The difference between being optimistic and pessimistic is that, in the former you will give yourself <strong><strong>more chance to become better.</strong></strong></p>
