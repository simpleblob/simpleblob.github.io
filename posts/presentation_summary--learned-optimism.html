<p>Presentation is <a
href="https://github.com/raganwald/presentations/blob/master/optimism.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>Optimism is the way we explain things that happened to us. There is
no one "correct" way, since they are just different interpretations from
the same information/situation.</p>
<p>The difference between being optimistic and pessimistic is that, in
the former you will give yourself ****more chance to become
better.****</p>

<strong>impersonal</strong>, <strong>specific</strong>, and
<strong>temporary</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>This</strong> pull request does not currently meet
<strong>our</strong> <strong>current</strong> standards, because these
<strong>specific</strong> A, B and C reasons."</p>
