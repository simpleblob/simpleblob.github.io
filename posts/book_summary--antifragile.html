<h2 id="book-i---introduction">Book I - Introduction</h2>
<p>The opposite of fragile is not robust. Robust means staying the same
under stress. Antifragile means getting better under stress.</p>
<h3 id="complexity-and-vulnerability">Complexity and Vulnerability</h3>
<p>Complex societies create more specialization, which makes them more
vulnerable to collapse. When everything is interconnected and
specialized, the whole system becomes easier to topple.</p>
<h3 id="historical-examples-of-antifragility">Historical Examples of
Antifragility</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mithridatization</strong> - Taking small doses of a
substance until you become immune to it</li>
<li><strong>Hormesis</strong> - Small doses of harmful substances can be
beneficial, acting as medicine. This creates redundancy in biological
systems.</li>
<li><strong>Fasting</strong> - Caloric restriction as a form of
hormesis</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts</h3>
<p><strong>Domain dependence:</strong> The rich person who has someone
carry his bag, then goes to the gym to exercise. We fail to see
connections across different domains.</p>
<p><strong>Compensation levels:</strong> Systems need the right amount
of stress. Too little stress leads to boredom and weakness. The right
amount of stress leads to growth.</p>
<p><strong>Stressors as information:</strong> When a system survives a
stressor, it gains valuable information to improve. Even if it doesn’t
survive, the group benefits from that information.</p>
<p><strong>Human stress patterns:</strong> Humans handle low frequency,
high severity stressors better than constant low-level stress, as long
as there’s ample rest time between stressors.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution through sacrifice:</strong> Evolution benefits the
group through sacrifice of individuals. The group becomes stronger after
surviving stressors, even when individuals don’t. Don’t mistake
population-level improvement for individual improvement.</p>
<h2 id="book-ii---modernity-and-the-denial-of-antifragility">Book II -
Modernity and the Denial of Antifragility</h2>
<h3 id="visible-vs-hidden-volatility">Visible vs Hidden Volatility</h3>
<p>Artisans like taxi drivers see income volatility every day. This lets
them adjust their strategy. Permanent employees face hidden volatility.
They’re unprepared when layoffs or job changes hit. The problem gets
worse because these events are rare but severe.</p>
<h3 id="variability-as-early-warning">Variability as Early Warning</h3>
<p>The more variability you observe in a system, the less vulnerable it
is to Black Swan events. Visible volatility is better than hidden
stability.</p>
<h3 id="centralization-creates-fragility">Centralization Creates
Fragility</h3>
<p>Centralized states like Russia are fragile. Decentralized city states
like Switzerland are antifragile.</p>
