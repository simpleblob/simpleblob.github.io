<h2 id="self-control-prefrontal-cortex-vs-brain-stem">Self-Control:
Prefrontal Cortex vs Brain Stem</h2>
<p>Self-control comes from the prefrontal cortex. It resists instincts
from the brain stem.</p>
<h3 id="key-principles">Key Principles</h3>
<p><strong>Instinct acts first.</strong> The instinctual self always
acts before the rational mind. We need to change direction after that
first impulse. This is why tracking the moment of decision matters.</p>
<p><strong>Heart rate variability predicts willpower.</strong> This is
the best proxy for your willpower reserve. Increase it by destressing
through exercise, sleep, and meditation. Get a quick boost by breathing
slowly, five times per minute.</p>
<p><strong>Willpower is a muscle.</strong> Keep pushing to grow
stronger. Find your strongest wants and use them when you’re at your
weakest.</p>
<p><strong>No moral accounting.</strong> Don’t justify good or bad
behavior as moral credits and debits. A misstep today predicts future
behavior. Each decision carries real weight.</p>
<p><strong>Desire vs reward.</strong> Dopamine drives us to seek
rewards, whether the actual reward exists or not. Slow down. Notice the
gap between promised and actual rewards. Use this to your advantage.
This might be key to engineering your own happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Forgive yourself.</strong> We’re only human. Willpower
failures happen. Shame and guilt will break you faster than the failure
itself.</p>
<p><strong>Predict temptation.</strong> Predicting how and when you
might be tempted increases the chance you’ll stay on track.</p>
<p><strong>Wait ten minutes.</strong> This strategy holds back the Beast
and brings out the Wise. “Surf the urge.” The urge is like a wave in the
ocean. It builds in intensity but ultimately crashes and resolves.</p>
<h2 id="future-discounting">Future Discounting</h2>
<p>A mind trick that makes future rewards less enticing than present
ones.</p>
<p><strong>Reverse the trick:</strong> Act as if you’ve already obtained
the future reward. You’ll lose it if you go for instant gratification
now.</p>
<h2 id="precommitment">Precommitment</h2>
<p>Limit your options. Burn down your ship. Try these tactics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Make choices in advance</strong> - Pack healthy lunch. Sign
up for training before you lose motivation.</li>
<li><strong>Make relapse difficult</strong> - Put your alarm far from
the bed.</li>
<li><strong>Motivate your future self</strong> - Wager money on
success.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="future-self">Future Self</h2>
<p>We think too highly of our future self, treating him as entirely
another person. Start thinking of him as having even less endurance than
the current you.</p>
<h2 id="mirror-neurons">Mirror Neurons</h2>
<p>We automatically mimic others’ actions. This is why we have empathy
and can be influenced by social groups.</p>
<h2 id="social-proof">Social Proof</h2>
<p>We follow whatever the group considers normal. Religion. Tradition.
Politics.</p>
<p>Use imagined social proof to appeal to emotions. This is easier than
rational arguments because it affects the Beast (System 1), not the Wise
(System 2).</p>
<p>Shame works better for weak or distant temptations. Pride works
better for strong emotions.</p>
<h2 id="ironic-rebounds">Ironic Rebounds</h2>
<p>Suppressing thoughts has the opposite effect. Don’t think about
something → you think about it. Try to sleep → you can’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Let thoughts flow through you. Feel what
you feel, but don’t believe it.</p>
