<h2
id="rule-1---you-can-choose-which-games-to-play-but-not-their-rules">Rule
1 - YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH GAMES TO PLAY, BUT NOT THEIR RULES</h2>
<ul>
<li>most frustration and unhappiness in life will come from not properly
playing the rules of the “game” – whichever game you are playing
(business, health, love, social life)</li>
<li>failures are feedback from life to help “teach” you the rules</li>
<li>below you will find 100 rules for life in general, learned through
author’s experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rule-2-to-8---prioritize-your-growth">Rule 2 to 8 - PRIORITIZE
YOUR GROWTH</h2>
<p>early and continuous speed-up will create momentum and make things
easier long-term.</p>
<h3 id="rule-2---the-very-important-never-feels-urgent">Rule 2 - THE
VERY IMPORTANT NEVER FEELS URGENT</h3>
<ul>
<li>most common regret on deathbed is life spent chasing urgents,
neglecting the importants.</li>
<li>important activities examples: family meals, learning, taking care
of health. we neglect them because these don’t have deadlines.</li>
<li>most what feels urgent is driven by someone else, so it’s important
to them, not you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ACTION: Make the very important urgent, now. put them within
your schedule, and be inflexible about them.</strong></p>
<h3
id="rule-3---problems-grow-to-the-size-they-need-for-you-to-acknowledge-them">Rule
3 - PROBLEMS GROW TO THE SIZE THEY NEED FOR YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM</h3>
<ul>
<li>it’s feedback loop / inertia. things will move in the same direction
until the condition changes. whether by environment or our own
action.</li>
<li>acknowledging problems is the frist step toward solving them and
regaining mental peace.</li>
<li>simply thinking about it is not enough – do write about it. the mind
needs material proof of acknowledgment.</li>
</ul>
<p>** ACTION: Write about your current problems. Do it right now. **</p>
<h3
id="rule-4---problems-are-not-solved-by-addressing-their-symptoms-but-by-addressing-their-root-cause">Rule
4 - PROBLEMS ARE NOT SOLVED BY ADDRESSING THEIR SYMPTOMS, BUT BY
ADDRESSING THEIR ROOT CAUSE</h3>
