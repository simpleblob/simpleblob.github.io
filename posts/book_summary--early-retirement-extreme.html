<h2 id="the-lock-in">The Lock-In</h2>
<p>Most people are trapped in a mass delusion: spending money equals
success.</p>
<h3 id="platos-cave">Plato’s Cave</h3>
<p>Like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave">Plato’s
cave</a>, most people follow a common life track: school → university →
career. This path is not efficient.</p>
<p><strong>The cost of specialization:</strong> Degrees and specialized
careers are fragile to change. Generalists fare better.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate ladder reality:</strong> The ladder is more like a
pyramid. Survivorship bias hides this truth.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-with-personal-finance">The Problem with Personal
Finance</h3>
<p><strong>Cash flow crisis:</strong> Single income stream. Many
debts.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer debt destroys wealth:</strong> Unlike business debt,
consumer debt does not generate income. Major consumer debt means
borrowing from an uncertain future.</p>
<p><strong>No savings buffer:</strong> Most households save nearly
nothing.</p>
<h3 id="retirement-a-modern-invention">Retirement: A Modern
Invention</h3>
<p>Retirement is a relatively new phenomenon from the 20th century. Most
early retirement resembles a long vacation. A net drain on society’s
productivity, just spending past accumulated wealth.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-out-of-the-lock-in">Breaking Out of the Lock-In</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduce waste and increase efficiency. Live at lower cost with the
same benefits.</li>
<li>Invest the gains from waste reduction in businesses.</li>
<li>Find something meaningful to do instead of traditional work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="economic-degrees-of-freedom">Economic Degrees of Freedom</h2>
<p>To understand a system, identify its degrees of freedom and
constraints.</p>
<h3 id="the-coupling-graph">The Coupling Graph</h3>
<p>We analyze economics using two axes:</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal axis (Coupling):</strong> From loose to tight.
Loosely coupled systems are less likely to fail.</p>
<p><strong>Vertical axis (Organization):</strong> From linear to
non-linear. Non-linear feedback creates convex payoffs.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Four Types of Workers Matrix</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="four-types-of-workers">Four Types of Workers</h3>
<p>Each type has different risks, rewards, and culture:</p>
<h4 id="salary-man-tightlinear">Salary Man (Tight/Linear)</h4>
<p>Tied to one employer. Fragile when things change. Rewards scale
linearly with effort, or less.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use options others create, but don’t create new ones</li>
<li>Work and consumption are well controlled. A cog in the machine.</li>
<li>All income goes to spending. No savings buffer.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/diagrams/salary-man-cashflow.svg"
alt="Salary Man Cash Flow" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Salary Man Cash Flow</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="working-man-looselinear">Working Man (Loose/Linear)</h4>
<p>Freelancers with uncertain income but less risk. Linear rewards.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep emergency funds because income varies</li>
<li>Work for many clients, not just one employer</li>
<li>Spend like salary men despite variable income</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="business-man-tightnon-linear">Business Man
(Tight/Non-Linear)</h4>
<p>Owns one or more businesses. Personal cash flow is tiny compared to
business cash flow under their control.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tight coupling to one or few businesses. Convex payoff.</li>
<li>Job is solving problems using assets and other people.</li>
<li>Must solve things quickly due to competition.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="renaissance-man-loosenon-linear">Renaissance Man
(Loose/Non-Linear)</h4>
<p>A combination of all three types.</p>
<ul>
<li>Competent in many fields. Can take full-time work when needed.</li>
<li>Generalist with many vocational skills. Picks up work based on
supply and demand.</li>
<li>Vast knowledge and experience solving complex problems
efficiently.</li>
<li>Does many things in-house: taxes, repairs, painting, cooking. This
cuts cash outflows considerably.</li>
<li>Owns assets and investments in various businesses.</li>
<li>Can make or do anything. A local leader and inspiration to
others.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="succession-and-cycles-of-change">Succession and Cycles of
Change</h3>
<p>Different types dominate at different stages. Like species in
nature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each type is adapted to thrive in a specific environment</li>
<li>When conditions change, the existing type gets outcompeted by one
better adapted to the new conditions</li>
<li>Succession occurs because the dominance of one type gradually
changes the environment</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ergodicity-and-destiny">Ergodicity and Destiny</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.barbellstrategy.com/blog/post-9mwgp-gw568">What
is ergodicity?</a> Space average equals time average. If you look at one
point over time, you get the same answer as looking at all space at one
time.</p>
<p>However, Jacob uses ergodicity slightly differently: With a certain
set of behaviors, over time, that species will end up where it deserves.
Luck plays a part in the short term, but not long term.</p>
<p><strong>Building agency:</strong> To achieve long-term goals, we need
agency to follow a set of behaviors through habit or sheer willpower
over time.</p>
<p>Agency is the attitude that any problem can be fixed, given enough
time, effort, and determination. Agency transfers across different
fields. To build it, grit through something very difficult at least once
in your life.</p>
<h3 id="our-current-world-climax-stage">Our Current World: Climax
Stage</h3>
<p>We have an economic model based on pulling resources from the ground,
turning them into unnecessary products, getting people to buy them, then
getting people to throw them away for newer products. This kind of GDP
is not sustainable.</p>
<h2 id="the-renaissance-ideal">The Renaissance Ideal</h2>
<h3 id="human-capital-and-personal-assets">Human Capital and Personal
Assets</h3>
<p>The Renaissance man builds capabilities across four domains:</p>
<h4 id="physiological">Physiological</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintain optimal physical and mental health</p></li>
<li><p>Know how the human body functions and adapts to stress,
overeating, lack of exercise, and their opposites</p></li>
<li><p>Know which foods promote health and which destroy it</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain good habits. Know how to preserve food and tell when
food is spoiled.</p></li>
<li><p>Be able to compete in local sports competitions</p></li>
<li><p>Be able to perform physically while exhausted, hungry, or tired.
Test: carrying an unconscious person from a burning house, or pulling
yourself up and hanging from a gutter.</p></li>
<li><p>Know at least basic first aid #### Intellectual</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize information relevance. Quickly research and find
relevant information across many areas. Learn independently with genuine
interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Have enough generalized knowledge to understand new information
and place it within a mental framework, model, or procedure. Use it to
ask further questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Recognize which problems the model applies to. Take a solution
from one problem, generalize it, and apply it to another
problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Critically analyze models, refine them, and combine different
models to achieve objectives. Practice critical thinking in all aspects
of life to reach rational certainty. Be open to new ideas but accept
nothing without examination.</p></li>
<li><p>Synthesize interdisciplinary information and connect similarities
that aren’t immediately apparent. Discover new models and
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate different methods, models, and procedures. Rank them by
utility. Pick the best one while recognizing the value of other methods.
Pursue relevant and correct knowledge persistently. Master the
fundamentals. #### Economic</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the difference between price and value. Value is
psychological. Price is determined by the market.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider more than immediate consequences. Think about future
consequences: opportunity cost and time-value of money. Learn to see the
unseen.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider consequences for all people, not just one
group.</p></li>
<li><p>Realize that economic agents represent special interests. They
interpret situations according to their own interests or political
views.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the difference between assets and liabilities.
Understand leverage and cash flows. Learn what is an investment
(income-generating asset) and what is not (items for personal
use).</p></li>
<li><p>Know the law of supply and demand. Know the difference between
savings and investments, and between present and future value.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand how stock, bond, and real estate markets work, both in
theory and practice.</p></li>
<li><p>Be able to do your own tax return, make a budget, and balance a
checkbook. #### Emotional</p></li>
<li><p>Appraise value in all matters to make sound decisions</p></li>
<li><p>Never waste time, money, effort, or resources</p></li>
<li><p>Resist emotional manipulation. Avoid wishful, magical thinking.
Don’t believe things are true because you want them to be true. Don’t
believe you can influence external events by thinking positively about
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Have strong character. Persist. Cope with adversity. Be resistant
to stress. Stay calm. Displace frustration.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a passion. Appreciate the arts and what it means to be
human, not just a “human resource.”</p></li>
<li><p>Be empathetic. Understand that people and situations are
complex.</p></li>
<li><p>Make social connections and increase the value of interpersonal
relationships</p></li>
<li><p>Patiently await a better solution. Be willing to compromise and
accept something close, but not exactly your ideal. #### Social</p></li>
<li><p>Get to know people outside your profession, hobby, religion,
political party, socioeconomic stratum, and country</p></li>
<li><p>Start or join a co-op. This can be anything from buying groceries
to participating in a tool shop to sharing movies with others.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to sell, barter, swap, and give things away</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to network and build your social capital</p></li>
<li><p>Get involved in politics on some level</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="technical">Technical</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Have knowledge of different professions’ skills to critically
judge the services of professionals</p></li>
<li><p>Have a working understanding of all the technology you use to
understand its limits and benefits</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to select optimal tools for your use, maintain them,
and repair them when they break down</p></li>
<li><p>Learn a common trade to barter your skills for other things ####
Ecological</p></li>
<li><p>Know the names of 5 grasses, 5 birds, 5 trees, etc. local to your
area. Be able to recognize them.</p></li>
<li><p>Know which food is in season and how much oil, water, and
fertilizer it takes to grow or raise food out of season or location.
Understand Liebig’s Law of the minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>Grow and sustain a garden without using pesticides, hybrid seeds,
or chemical fertilizer. A garden achieves maximum integrity when it is
in balance, and when growth is stable and resilient without ongoing
external interference.</p></li>
<li><p>Promote functional diversity to retain adaptive capacity. Allow
evolution to happen when the environment changes. Consider adaptive and
evolutionary potential before interfering. Action always has reactions.
Action is not always a good idea.</p></li>
<li><p>Always consider the system. Understand both the parts and the
whole. No parts exist without the whole. The whole doesn’t exist without
the parts. Everything relates to everything else, mostly indirectly.
Changing one part changes the whole.</p></li>
<li><p>Recognize multiple bottom lines, flows, and balances in terms of
primary, secondary, and tertiary consumers, producers, and
decomposers.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the maximum power principle: systems strive to maximize the
rate of useful work. Don’t waste energy to the environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the concept of characteristic scales in terms of
change and the effect of limits on competition and cooperation.
Understand the difference between positive and negative feedbacks (both
are needed) and how linking feedbacks lead to cycles, runaways, or
overshoots.</p></li>
<li><p>Study the structure and principles of different systems to build
a collection of models for understanding other systems. ### The
Renaissance Education</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Principles over techniques:</strong> Fundamental principles,
concepts, or structures are more important than specific techniques.
Principles always apply to other fields.</p>
<p><strong>Learning by doing:</strong> People remember most of what they
do, some of what they say, but little of what they see or hear.
Therefore, do things. In cooking, leave ingredients out or substitute
new ones to see what happens. In sports, practice unmastered techniques
actively and combine them with other techniques. In finance, try
investing in different things.</p>
<h3 id="gauging-mastery">Gauging Mastery</h3>
<p><strong>Time-based:</strong> 1,000 hours to Journeyman. 10,000 hours
to Expert.</p>
<p><strong>Progression:</strong> Copying → Comparing → Compiling
(collecting) → Computing (pairing) → Coordinating (refining) → Creating
(synthesis)</p>
<h3 id="decoupling-and-increasing-complexity">Decoupling and Increasing
Complexity</h3>
<p>Increasing complexity means higher capability, often at the cost of
higher maintenance or lost responsiveness to change.</p>
<p>Simplicity, often by decoupling several joined variables, makes the
system more predictable and easier to maintain or change. An even better
way is to use abstractions (lossless compression) to maintain capability
and simplify systems.</p>
<p>Complex systems, if designed well, are more resilient than simple
systems.</p>
<p>Work switching has a cost, depending on the nature of work. Managers
versus hackers.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-tactics-and-guiding-principles">Strategy, Tactics, and
Guiding Principles</h2>
<h3 id="plan-vs-tactic-vs-strategy">Plan vs Tactic vs Strategy</h3>
<p><strong>Tactic:</strong> Detailed concrete steps to reach a goal.</p>
<p><strong>Plan:</strong> A string of actions following a certain path.
Get a single error, stop.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> A web of actions. A line gets cut, move to
another line toward the goal.</p>
<h3 id="strategic-principles">Strategic Principles</h3>
<p><strong>Modular design:</strong> Decouple and switch between modules
easily. This decreases dependencies and increases resiliency. Example:
being capable of getting more than one job (income module), or having
several paths to get what you want (expense module): haircut from a
salon, doing it yourself, or knowing a friend with the skill.</p>
<p><strong>Work to learn:</strong> Don’t work to earn money. Work to
learn new skills, gain new connections, and create new
opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Valuable hobbies:</strong> Focus on hobbies and projects that
are at least free or can produce value or earn money.</p>
<p><strong>Holon:</strong> Prefer strong coupling within the project or
module and loose or no coupling to the external world.</p>
<p><strong>Keep modules simple:</strong> Make modules simple, small, and
not time-critical as much as possible. You can wait to buy stuff at a
better price.</p>
<p><strong>Vector thinking:</strong> Each action is a vector in
multi-dimensional goal space (one goal per axis). Each second or nth
order effect changes the direction and magnitude of that vector. To
simplify, think of the effect as positive or negative to each goal and
combine them.</p>
<p><strong>Goals as properties:</strong> Define goals as properties:
losing or saving money, decreasing or increasing health, etc.</p>
<h3 id="tactical-principles">Tactical Principles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a list of needs or wants, ranked by value and preference</li>
<li>Pick the ranked item suitable to the resource at hand</li>
<li>Fulfill them with an appropriate response, using minimum resources
to achieve them. Just right.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-renaissance-lifestyle">A Renaissance Lifestyle</h2>
<p>The strategy for living like a Renaissance man:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce wants and needs from the marketplace to a minimum. Decouple
the buy-work connection.</li>
<li>Decrease the volume and size but increase the sophistication of your
activities and possessions.</li>
<li>Measure prosperity by less activity, not more. Do fewer useless
things.</li>
<li>Work for money for no more than five years of your life or five
hours a week.</li>
<li>Avoid generating waste. Find ways to use the waste of others.</li>
<li>Learn to use the system to your advantage, but don’t be evil.</li>
<li>Serve yourself rather than having others serve you. Instead, help
them.</li>
<li>Keep running costs down but pay for value.</li>
<li>Maintain health to avoid the personal and monetary cost of
sickness.</li>
<li>Build up the capital to live as a capitalist or the skills to always
find a new job.</li>
<li>Focus on developing skills rather than on passive
entertainment.</li>
<li>Gain maximum satisfaction with minimum expenditure of money and
energy. ### Things</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why possessions are mendokusai (troublesome):</strong> They
cost money, take up space, require maintenance, may lead to getting more
things, can get stolen, and are hard to get rid of.</p>
<p><strong>What should we own:</strong> Things that have suitable
quality and low lifetime cost. Durable. Small or lightweight. Easy to
maintain and get rid of.</p>
<p><strong>Annual cost</strong> = (bought price - used price) / years
used</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Do invest in things you use often.</p>
<h3 id="housing">Housing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get the smallest unit that is comfortable to you</li>
<li>Consider time-usage of rooms. Example: bedroom gets used 8/24 = 33%
of the time.</li>
<li>Location: Very close to grocery outlet and work. Walking distance
preferred.</li>
<li>Japan: Safety from natural disasters is paramount.</li>
<li>Other: Crime or theft safety, conditions at night, electricity or
internet uptime, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have to work, remote work or flexible hours work is
ideal</li>
<li>Consider moving close to work as much as possible, if needed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="food-supply">Food Supply</h3>
<ul>
<li>Buy bulk, once a month, seasonal ingredients</li>
<li>Grow your own food (permaculture)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="foundations-of-economics-and-finance">Foundations of Economics
and Finance</h2>
<h3 id="the-ecosystem-loop">The Ecosystem Loop</h3>
<p><strong>Complete ecosystem:</strong> Resources → Producers →
Consumers → Decomposers</p>
<p><strong>Modern economics:</strong> Only Producers → Consumers</p>
<p>The economy can’t keep growing forever without killing itself if the
cycle isn’t completed.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/diagrams/ecosystem-loop.svg"
alt="Ecosystem Loop Comparison" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Ecosystem Loop Comparison</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="the-ere-goal">The ERE Goal</h3>
<p>The key goal for an Early Retirement Extreme investor is to create an
ecosystem or asset that can sustain itself plus the investor.</p>
<h3 id="the-workforce-reality">The Workforce Reality</h3>
<p>Since full-salaried pay often has more to do with negotiation skills,
politics, or tenure rather than productivity, the workforce divides into
three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work horses</strong> - Clueless, doing all the work</li>
<li><strong>Show horses</strong> - Political, focused on
appearances</li>
<li><strong>Horses’ asses</strong> - Doing minimum work since pay is the
same</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="accumulation-phase">Accumulation Phase</h3>
<p>Full-time salaried work is still good for the fund accumulating
phase, but optimize the trade-off for time and freedom.</p>
<h3 id="key-numbers">Key Numbers</h3>
<p>30 years of expenses saved and Safe Withdrawal Rate (SWR) of 3% for
long-term sustainability.</p>
