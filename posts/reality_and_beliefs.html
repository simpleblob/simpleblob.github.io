<p>There are many ideas/beliefs in the world, but the way for them to
spread and sustain themselves follow some rules.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>it must have a spread/infect vector. Belief can be beneficial to
individual or to the group, combined with network effects work even
better.
<ul>
<li>example one: tit-for-tat, both benefits</li>
<li>example two: christianity, believing in only "one true god" shuts
down other god ideas</li>
<li>example three: believing certain idea that gets worse if more people
know about it –&gt; idea just die out very quickly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>it must be stable or have equilibrium state. after it gains
believers and saturate, it should not suffer from volatility of in-group
believers. (must not implode by itself)</li>
<li>it does not need to adhere to reality, as long as the whole group
can be convinced to believe in it, and it follows the above two rules.
<ul>
<li>example one: critical theory of race. spread by shutting up
non-believers with socially unacceptable labels.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Humans, on average, might not be long-term smart enough to avoid
"catastrophic" beliefs (cannot use reason/logic as anti-mind-virus,
because they are already close-minded or have low rationality), so must
be nudged/persuaded/fooled away from those beliefs.</p>
<p>Some self-sustaining beliefs</p>
<ul>
<li>religions - christianity, islam, buddhism</li>
<li>political ideology - capitalism, democracy, socialism</li>
<li>philosophical ideology - science</li>
</ul>
<p>Those beliefs can cause effects (certain preferred values go
up/down), but there are no object values.</p>
<ul>
<li>capitalism - mean wealth goes up, variance increase a lot</li>
<li>communist - mean wealth goes down, variance effectively zero</li>
<li>dictatorship - mean wealth goes down, variance is down. selected
group wealth is through the roof.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some evidence that once one belief is gone, it must be
filled with another, to fill up the void. Religious thought is the most
obvious.</p>
