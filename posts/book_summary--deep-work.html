<h2 id="the-new-economys-winners">The New Economy’s Winners</h2>
<p>In today’s rapidly changing technological landscape, three groups
have massive advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-skilled workers who can work creatively with intelligent
machines</li>
<li>Superstars who are the best at what they do</li>
<li>Owners who have access to capital</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-abilities-for-thriving">Two Abilities for Thriving</h3>
<p>To succeed in this winner-takes-all economy, you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to quickly master hard things</li>
<li>The ability to produce at an elite level in both quality and
speed</li>
</ul>
<p>These two abilities are greatly enhanced by maximizing deep work time
and its intensity.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<h3 id="deep-work">Deep Work</h3>
<p>Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free
concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.
These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to
replicate.</p>
<h3 id="shallow-work">Shallow Work</h3>
<p>Non-cognitively demanding logistical tasks, often performed while
distracted. These efforts create little new value in the world and are
easy to replicate.</p>
<h3 id="recognizing-deep-vs-shallow-work">Recognizing Deep vs Shallow
Work</h3>
<p>Ask yourself: How long would it take in months to train a smart
recent college graduate with no specialized training to complete this
task?</p>
<p>Anything less than 3 months is definitely shallow work.</p>
<h2 id="the-rules">The Rules</h2>
<h3 id="choose-your-deep-work-schedule">Choose Your Deep Work
Schedule</h3>
<p>Pick one schedule type and stick with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consecutive days in a week or month dedicated fully to deep
work</li>
<li>Fixed hours every day for deep work, typically in the morning</li>
<li>Flexible hours every day where you can switch focus at will</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-the-habit">Build the Habit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ritualize it.</strong> Use triggers. Enforce a fixed number
of hours. Then completely stop work for the rest of the day.</li>
<li><strong>Protect downtime.</strong> At the end of each workday, shut
down all work thoughts and actions. Say “Shutdown complete” as a
trigger.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace boredom.</strong> Train your brain not to act on
your first desire for novelty.</li>
<li><strong>Quit social media.</strong> Or limit it to once per
day.</li>
<li><strong>Drain the shallow.</strong> Work a fixed eight hours per
day. This forces you to prioritize deep work.</li>
</ul>
