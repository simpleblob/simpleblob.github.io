<h2 id="in-the-new-economy-with-rapid-growth-in-technology-there-are-3-groups-with-massive-advantages">In the new economy with rapid growth in technology, there are 3 groups with massive advantages</h2>
<ol>
<li>Those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines (high-skilled workers)</li>
<li>Those who are the best at what they do (superstars)</li>
<li>Those with access to capital (owners)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="abilities-for-thriving-in-the-new-info-winners-take-all-economy">2 abilities for thriving in the new info-winners-take-all economy</h2>
<ol>
<li>The ability to quickly master hard things</li>
<li>The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed</li>
</ol>
<p>These two are enhanced greatly by maximizing deep work time and its intensity.</p>
<h2 id="definition"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>
<h3 id="deep-work">Deep work:</h3>
<p>Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.</p>
<h3 id="shallow-work">Shallow work:</h3>
<p>Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-recognize-deep-work-vs-shallow-work">How to recognize deep work vs shallow work?</h3>
<p>Ask yourself this: How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?</p>
<p>Anything less than 3 months is definitely on the shallow end.</p>
<h2 id="the-rules">The Rules:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Decide on your deep work schedule type
<ol>
<li>x consecutive days in a week or month of all-days deep work</li>
<li>x hours every day of deep work (in the morning)</li>
<li>x hours every day (can switch focus at will)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Ritualize it. Have triggers. Enforce a fixed x hours. Then just don’t do it at all for the rest of the day</li>
<li>Downtime is essential for optimal schedule. At the end of workday, shut down all your work action/thoughts. say “Shutdown complete&quot;</li>
<li>Embrace boredom. Train your brain <strong>not</strong> to act on your first desire for novelty.</li>
<li>Quit Social Media. Or check it just once per day.</li>
<li>Work at a fixed 8 hours per day to “Drain the shallow” out of life. we will have time only for deep work.</li>
</ol>
