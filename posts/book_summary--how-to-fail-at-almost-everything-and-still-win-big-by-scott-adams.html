<h2 id="fail-toward-success-tactics">Fail-toward-success tactics</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Goals are for losers. Use Systems.</li>
<li>Your mind isn’t magic. It’s an organic computer you can (sort of)
program.</li>
<li>The most important metric to track is your personal energy.</li>
<li>Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success.</li>
<li>Happiness is health plus freedom.</li>
<li>Luck can be managed, sort of.</li>
<li>Conquer shyness by being a huge phony (in a good way).</li>
<li>Fitness is the lever that moves the world.</li>
<li>Simplicity transform ordinary into amazing.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-6-filters-for-truth">The 6 Filters for Truth</h2>
<p>(Commonly what we do given constraint)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Personal experience (biased)</li>
<li>Experience of people you know (more bias)</li>
<li>Experts (They work for money, not for truth)</li>
<li>Scientific studies (correlation not causation)</li>
<li>Common sense (works until it’s wrong)</li>
<li>Pattern recognition (Patterns, coincidence,  and personal bias look
alike)</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s why you should try to use different sources and hope that it
rules out random noise once combined.</p>
<p>Look for consistency in answers. <em>Multiple models by Charlie
Munger.</em></p>
<h2 id="failure-as-tool-to-get-information">Failure as tool to get
information</h2>
<p>Failure always brings something valuable with it. Don’t let it leave
until you extract that value. Mug the shit out of it.</p>
<h2 id="goal-vs-system">Goal vs System</h2>
<p>A goal is a specific objective that you either achieve or don’t
sometime in the future.</p>
<p>A system is something you do on a regular basis that increases your
odds of happiness in the long run.</p>
<p>This is partly semantics, but it’s helpful to think this way. Same as
career capital.</p>
<p>It’s roughly more like a single point of success vs daily practices
to get there.</p>
<p>However, a daily practice can help you reach multiple goals. That’s a
good side effect. Be flexible, do pivot if reasonable.</p>
<h2 id="deciding-vs-wanting-success">Deciding vs Wanting Success</h2>
<p>Wishing starts in the mind, and usually stays there. If want to
achieve success, figure out the price, then pay it.</p>
<h2
id="you-have-permission-to-put-your-self-interest-first-charity-second">You
have permission to put your self-interest first, charity second</h2>
<p>The most important form of self-interest involves</p>
<ul>
<li>spending time on your fitness,</li>
<li>eating right,</li>
<li>pursuing your career, and still</li>
<li>spending quality time with your family and friends.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ch11-maximized-your-energy">CH11: Maximized your Energy</h2>
<p>We humans want many things: good health, financial freedom,
accomplishment, a great social life, love, sex, recreation, travel,
family, career, and more.</p>
<p>The way I approach the problem of multiple priorities is by focusing
on just one main metric: my energy.</p>
<p>I make choices that maximize my personal energy because that makes it
easier to manage all of the other priorities.</p>
<p>Maximizing my personal energy means eating right, exercising,
avoiding unnecessary stress, getting enough sleep, and all of the
obvious steps.</p>
<p>But it also means having something in my life that makes me excited
to wake up.</p>
<p>One example: During my corporate days, I always had one or two side
projects going on that had the potential to set me free.</p>
<p>For years, the prospect of starting “my own thing” and leaving my
cubicle behind gave me an enormous amount of energy.</p>
<h3 id="tricks-for-getting-most-energy">Tricks for getting most
energy</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Match creative work to time of day</li>
<li>Be simplifying instead of optimising – allow some time buffer for
less stress</li>
<li>Place matching – Bed only for sleeping, Desk for work, couch for
games</li>
<li>Keep things Tidy - mentally clear</li>
<li>Don’t be scared of lack of knowledge of "how to do something" - 90%
Can be solved by Google and the 10% by asking other people</li>
<li>Don’t be an asshole</li>
<li>Set the right priorities
<ol type="1">
<li>Your health</li>
<li>Your economics (money, career)</li>
<li>Family and friends</li>
<li>Local community, country, the world</li>
</ol></li>
