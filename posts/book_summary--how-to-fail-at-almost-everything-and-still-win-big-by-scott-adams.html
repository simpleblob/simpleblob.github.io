<h2 id="core-ideas">Core Ideas</h2>
<h3 id="optimize-personal-energy">Optimize Personal Energy</h3>
<p>Your energy level determines everything else. Maximize it
through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper diet</li>
<li>Regular exercise</li>
<li>Adequate sleep</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="optimize-personal-luck">Optimize Personal Luck</h3>
<p>Success is not random, but you can improve your odds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move from strategies with bad odds to ones with good odds</li>
<li>Stay in the game long enough for luck to find you</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="optimize-happiness">Optimize Happiness</h3>
<p>Three factors drive happiness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good health</li>
<li>Sufficient resources</li>
<li>Flexible schedule</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-principles">Key Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goals are for losers. Use systems instead.</strong> Focus on
daily practices rather than distant targets.</li>
<li><strong>Your mind is not magic.</strong> It’s an organic computer
you can program through repetition and habits.</li>
<li><strong>Track your personal energy above all else.</strong> This is
the most important metric.</li>
<li><strong>Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of
success.</strong> Build a diverse skill stack.</li>
<li><strong>Happiness is health plus freedom.</strong> These two factors
matter more than anything else.</li>
<li><strong>Luck can be managed, sort of.</strong> Put yourself in
positions where good things can happen.</li>
<li><strong>Conquer shyness by being a phony in a good way.</strong> Act
confident until it becomes real.</li>
<li><strong>Fitness is the lever that moves the world.</strong> Physical
health enables everything else.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity transforms ordinary into amazing.</strong> Simple
solutions beat complex ones.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-six-filters-for-truth">The Six Filters for Truth</h2>
<p>Most people use these filters to evaluate what’s true, given
real-world constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal experience</strong> - Highly biased by your unique
circumstances</li>
<li><strong>Experience of people you know</strong> - Even more biased,
limited sample size</li>
<li><strong>Experts</strong> - They work for money, not for truth</li>
<li><strong>Scientific studies</strong> - Often confuse correlation with
causation</li>
<li><strong>Common sense</strong> - Works until it suddenly doesn’t</li>
<li><strong>Pattern recognition</strong> - Patterns, coincidence, and
personal bias look identical</li>
</ul>
<p>Use multiple sources and look for consistency across different
filters. This helps rule out random noise. Charlie Munger calls this
approach “multiple models.”</p>
<h2 id="failure-as-tool-to-get-information">Failure as tool to get
information</h2>
<p>Failure always brings something valuable with it. Don’t let it leave
until you extract that value. Mug the shit out of it.</p>
<h2 id="goal-vs-system">Goal vs System</h2>
<p>A goal is a specific objective that you either achieve or don’t
sometime in the future.</p>
<p>A system is something you do on a regular basis that increases your
odds of happiness in the long run.</p>
<p>This is partly semantics, but it’s helpful to think this way. Same as
career capital.</p>
<p>It’s roughly more like a single point of success vs daily practices
to get there.</p>
<p>However, a daily practice can help you reach multiple goals. That’s a
good side effect. Be flexible, do pivot if reasonable.</p>
<h2 id="deciding-vs-wanting-success">Deciding vs Wanting Success</h2>
<p>Wishing starts in the mind, and usually stays there. If want to
achieve success, figure out the price, then pay it.</p>
<h2
id="you-have-permission-to-put-your-self-interest-first-charity-second">You
have permission to put your self-interest first, charity second</h2>
<p>The most important form of self-interest involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spending time on your fitness</li>
<li>Eating right</li>
<li>Pursuing your career</li>
<li>Spending quality time with your family and friends</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ch11-maximized-your-energy">CH11: Maximized your Energy</h2>
<p>We humans want many things: good health, financial freedom,
accomplishment, a great social life, love, sex, recreation, travel,
family, career, and more.</p>
<p>The way I approach the problem of multiple priorities is by focusing
on just one main metric: my energy.</p>
<p>I make choices that maximize my personal energy because that makes it
easier to manage all of the other priorities.</p>
<p>Maximizing my personal energy means eating right, exercising,
avoiding unnecessary stress, getting enough sleep, and all of the
obvious steps.</p>
<p>But it also means having something in my life that makes me excited
to wake up.</p>
<p>One example: During my corporate days, I always had one or two side
projects going on that had the potential to set me free.</p>
<p>For years, the prospect of starting “my own thing” and leaving my
cubicle behind gave me an enormous amount of energy.</p>
<h3 id="maximizing-energy">Maximizing Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Match work to your energy.</strong> Do creative work when
your energy peaks during the day.</li>
<li><strong>Simplify instead of optimize.</strong> Build time buffers to
reduce stress.</li>
<li><strong>Match places to activities.</strong> Bed for sleeping. Desk
for work. Couch for relaxing.</li>
<li><strong>Keep things tidy.</strong> Physical order creates mental
clarity.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t fear ignorance.</strong> Google solves 90% of
problems. Other people solve the rest.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t be an asshole.</strong> It drains everyone’s energy,
including yours.</li>
<li><strong>Set the right priorities:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>Your health</li>
<li>Your economics (money and career)</li>
<li>Family and friends</li>
<li>Local community, country, the world</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
