## The New Economy's Winners

In today's rapidly changing technological landscape, three groups have massive advantages:

- High-skilled workers who can work creatively with intelligent machines
- Superstars who are the best at what they do
- Owners who have access to capital

### Two Abilities for Thriving

To succeed in this winner-takes-all economy, you need:

- The ability to quickly master hard things
- The ability to produce at an elite level in both quality and speed

These two abilities are greatly enhanced by maximizing deep work time and its intensity.

## Definitions

### Deep Work

Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

### Shallow Work

Non-cognitively demanding logistical tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts create little new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

### Recognizing Deep vs Shallow Work

Ask yourself: How long would it take in months to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training to complete this task?

Anything less than 3 months is definitely shallow work.

## The Rules

### Choose Your Deep Work Schedule

Pick one schedule type and stick with it:

- Consecutive days in a week or month dedicated fully to deep work
- Fixed hours every day for deep work, typically in the morning
- Flexible hours every day where you can switch focus at will

### Build the Habit

- **Ritualize it.** Use triggers. Enforce a fixed number of hours. Then completely stop work for the rest of the day.
- **Protect downtime.** At the end of each workday, shut down all work thoughts and actions. Say "Shutdown complete" as a trigger.
- **Embrace boredom.** Train your brain not to act on your first desire for novelty.
- **Quit social media.** Or limit it to once per day.
- **Drain the shallow.** Work a fixed eight hours per day. This forces you to prioritize deep work.
