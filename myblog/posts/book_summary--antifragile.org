** Book I - Introduction
  - Opposite of fragile is not robust (unharmed), it is antifragile (improved).
  - Complex societies >> more specialization >> more vulnerable to collapse
    (easier to topple balance)
  - Some histories
    - Mithridatization = small dose of substance until immune to it
    - Hormesis = small dose of harmful substance actually beneficial, act as
      medicine --> a form of creating redundancy in systems
    - a fast (caloric restriction)
  - Domain dependence = rich person has someone carry bag for him, to go to the
    gym to exercise
  - Under-compensation (no stressors, too bored) and over-compensation (good
    level of stressors)
  - Stressors are information that system can use to improve (after it
    survives that stressor, or if not, the group can still benefit from the
    info)
  - humans tend to do better with low freq/high severity stressors, with ample
    rest time
  - Evolution is group benefiting from sacrifice of the few. Individuals might
    not become stronger, but the group is, after surviving stressors (with
    valuable information)
  - be careful of mistaking some cases as individual improvement rather than
    culling out the weak
