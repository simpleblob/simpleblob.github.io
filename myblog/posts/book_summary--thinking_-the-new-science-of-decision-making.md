## 1 The normal well-tempered mind (Daniel Dennett)

-   deconstruction technique is usually applied to understand the Mind.
    Break stuff down until simple structures are found that can be
    replaced by machines. Neurons in this case.
-   Turns out Neurons are more complex than we thought. They\'re like
    little agents and can form coalitions and fight other groups for
    control.
-   even at the level of genes, there are complex interactions like
    these.
-   so the Mind is like an anarchy/chaotic state rather than orderly
    machine.
-   an organized mind is an achievement. A goal to yearn for.
-   recent explosion of big data accelerate research. However need more
    analytic capabilities.
-   previously a popular brain model is a logic gate if/then/else. Now
    it\'s a massively parallel fuzzy machine.
-   Control is key to understanding. How do you control a parallel
    system. Obviously not from top - down.
