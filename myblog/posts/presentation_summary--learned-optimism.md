Presentation is
[here](https://github.com/raganwald/presentations/blob/master/optimism.md).

Optimism is the way we explain things that happened to us. There is no
one \"correct\" way, since they are just different interpretations from
the same information/situation.

The difference between being optimistic and pessimistic is that, in the
former you will give yourself ****more chance to become better.****

## Three Axes of Explanations

How we explain events shapes our mindset. Each explanation falls on three spectrums:

### Impersonal vs Personal

**Pessimistic:** They don't like my work because of me.

**Optimistic:** They don't like my work because it lacks some features they want.

### General vs Specific

**Pessimistic:** They don't like my work because it probably sucks at everything.

**Optimistic:** They don't like my work because it probably lacks feature A.

### Permanent vs Temporary

**Pessimistic:** People always hate my work my whole life, and it's not going to change.

**Optimistic:** They don't like my work. A guy told me on that day.

## Learned Optimism in Practice

Frame good and bad events differently to maximize your chances:

**Optimistic praise** for good things should be personal, general, and permanent:

> "This issue you filed shows why **you** have been and will **continue** to be an **asset** to the community."

**Optimistic criticism** for bad things should be impersonal, specific, and temporary:

> "**This** pull request does not currently meet **our** **current** standards, because these **specific** A, B and C reasons."
