## Book I - Introduction

-   Opposite of fragile is not robust (unharmed), it is antifragile
    (improved).
-   Complex societies \>\> more specialization \>\> more vulnerable to
    collapse (easier to topple balance)
-   Some histories
    -   Mithridatization = small dose of substance until immune to it
    -   Hormesis = small dose of harmful substance actually beneficial,
        act as medicine --\> a form of creating redundancy in systems
    -   a fast (caloric restriction)
-   Domain dependence = rich person has someone carry bag for him, to go
    to the gym to exercise
-   Under-compensation (no stressors, too bored) and over-compensation
    (good level of stressors)
-   Stressors are information that system can use to improve (after it
    survives that stressor, or if not, the group can still benefit from
    the info)
-   humans tend to do better with low freq/high severity stressors, with
    ample rest time
-   Evolution is group benefiting from sacrifice of the few. Individuals
    might not become stronger, but the group is, after surviving
    stressors (with valuable information)
-   Be careful of mistaking some cases as individual improvement rather
    than culling out the weak

## Book II - Modernity and the Denial of Antifragility

-   Artisans (taxi drivers etc.) has seen explicit volatility of
    day-by-day income, hence can adjust strategy accordingly. Permanent
    employees however, are generally unprepared for the (hidden) coming
    layoff or job changes. The problem is exacerbated by the low-freq /
    high-sev of these events.
-   Usually the more variability is observed in a system, the less Black
    Swan-prone it is.
-   Centralized state (Russia) is fragile, while City state
    (Switzerland) is antifragile.
