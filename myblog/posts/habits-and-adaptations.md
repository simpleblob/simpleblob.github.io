Body and Mind adapt to anything/any situation. It just takes time. As
long as the \"stress\" does not break the body and/or mind. The
adaptation slowly happens.

The key is to sustain that period until adaptation happens. Which means
making habits. Need to have a trigger and positive reward after the
event.
