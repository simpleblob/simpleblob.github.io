## Crash Course summary

-   Everything is made of Atoms
    -   Very old theory since B.C., finally Einstein proved it.
        -   someone noticed a small pollen jiggling under microscope
            without anything near it. That was actually caused by
            brownian motions of the surrounding invisible (to the eye)
            molecules.
        -   with the motion equation, we can predict the pollen
            trajectory perfectly.
