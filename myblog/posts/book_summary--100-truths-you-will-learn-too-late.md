## Rule 1 - YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH GAMES TO PLAY, BUT NOT THEIR RULES

* most frustration and unhappiness in life will come from not properly playing the rules of the "game" -- whichever game you are playing (business, health, love, social life)
* failures are feedback from life to help "teach" you the rules
* below you will find 100 rules for life in general, learned through author's experience.

## Rule 2 to 8 - PRIORITIZE YOUR GROWTH

early and continuous speed-up will create momentum and make things easier long-term.

### Rule 2 - THE VERY IMPORTANT NEVER FEELS URGENT

* most common regret on deathbed is life spent chasing urgents, neglecting the importants.
* important activities examples: family meals, learning, taking care of health. we neglect them because these don't have deadlines.
* most what feels urgent is driven by someone else, so it's important to them, not you.

**ACTION: Make the very important urgent, now. put them within your schedule, and be inflexible about them.**
