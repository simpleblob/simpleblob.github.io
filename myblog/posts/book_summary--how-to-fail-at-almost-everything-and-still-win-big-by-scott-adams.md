## Core Ideas

### Optimize Personal Energy

Your energy level determines everything else. Maximize it through:

- Proper diet
- Regular exercise
- Adequate sleep

### Optimize Personal Luck

Success is not random, but you can improve your odds:

- Move from strategies with bad odds to ones with good odds
- Stay in the game long enough for luck to find you

### Optimize Happiness

Three factors drive happiness:

- Good health
- Sufficient resources
- Flexible schedule

## Key Principles

- **Goals are for losers. Use systems instead.** Focus on daily practices rather than distant targets.
- **Your mind is not magic.** It's an organic computer you can program through repetition and habits.
- **Track your personal energy above all else.** This is the most important metric.
- **Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success.** Build a diverse skill stack.
- **Happiness is health plus freedom.** These two factors matter more than anything else.
- **Luck can be managed, sort of.** Put yourself in positions where good things can happen.
- **Conquer shyness by being a phony in a good way.** Act confident until it becomes real.
- **Fitness is the lever that moves the world.** Physical health enables everything else.
- **Simplicity transforms ordinary into amazing.** Simple solutions beat complex ones.

## The Six Filters for Truth

Most people use these filters to evaluate what's true, given real-world constraints:

- **Personal experience** - Highly biased by your unique circumstances
- **Experience of people you know** - Even more biased, limited sample size
- **Experts** - They work for money, not for truth
- **Scientific studies** - Often confuse correlation with causation
- **Common sense** - Works until it suddenly doesn't
- **Pattern recognition** - Patterns, coincidence, and personal bias look identical

Use multiple sources and look for consistency across different filters. This helps rule out random noise. Charlie Munger calls this approach "multiple models."

## Failure as tool to get information

Failure always brings something valuable with it. Don't let it leave
until you extract that value. Mug the shit out of it.

## Goal vs System

A goal is a specific objective that you either achieve or don't
sometime in the future.

A system is something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds
of happiness in the long run.

This is partly semantics, but it's helpful to think this way. Same as
career capital.

It's roughly more like a single point of success vs daily practices to
get there.

However, a daily practice can help you reach multiple goals. That's a
good side effect. Be flexible, do pivot if reasonable.

## Deciding vs Wanting Success

Wishing starts in the mind, and usually stays there. If want to achieve
success, figure out the price, then pay it.

## You have permission to put your self-interest first, charity second

The most important form of self-interest involves:

- Spending time on your fitness
- Eating right
- Pursuing your career
- Spending quality time with your family and friends

## CH11: Maximized your Energy

We humans want many things: good health, financial freedom,
accomplishment, a great social life, love, sex, recreation, travel,
family, career, and more.

The way I approach the problem of multiple priorities is by focusing on
just one main metric: my energy.

I make choices that maximize my personal energy because that makes it
easier to manage all of the other priorities.

Maximizing my personal energy means eating right, exercising, avoiding
unnecessary stress, getting enough sleep, and all of the obvious steps.

But it also means having something in my life that makes me excited to
wake up.

One example: During my corporate days, I always had one or two side
projects going on that had the potential to set me free.

For years, the prospect of starting "my own thing" and leaving my
cubicle behind gave me an enormous amount of energy.

### Maximizing Energy

- **Match work to your energy.** Do creative work when your energy peaks during the day.
- **Simplify instead of optimize.** Build time buffers to reduce stress.
- **Match places to activities.** Bed for sleeping. Desk for work. Couch for relaxing.
- **Keep things tidy.** Physical order creates mental clarity.
- **Don't fear ignorance.** Google solves 90% of problems. Other people solve the rest.
- **Don't be an asshole.** It drains everyone's energy, including yours.
- **Set the right priorities:**
    1. Your health
    2. Your economics (money and career)
    3. Family and friends
    4. Local community, country, the world
