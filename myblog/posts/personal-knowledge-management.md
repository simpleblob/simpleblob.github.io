## Summary of Ideas

-   A connected system for \"note cards\"
-   \"One thought, One card\" -- how about one-letter one-card as a
    linked list?
-   a hypertext card allows one with write up a [whole
    book](http://www.openculture.com/2014/02/the-notecards-on-which-vladimir-nabokov-wrote-lolita.html)
